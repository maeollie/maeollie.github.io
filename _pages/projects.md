## Digital.gov: Standing up a content operations infrastructure

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 

When I joined the team as a federal employee, [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov) had recently doubled the size of its content team but lacked the content governance necessary to achieve its product goals. I took on leadership of the content workstream, incrementally building mature and sustainable content operations based on team needs and existing rituals. 

As a result of this work, our team significantly reduced the response time for content submissions while improving the siteâ€™s Digital Certainty Index in SiteImprove. These efforts drove a 40% increase in monthly pageviews over six months in 2024 compared to the same timeframe in 2023.

### My role
* Build an editorial content calendar that aligned messaging across web, social media, and email platforms
* Establish intake and evaluation processes to strengthen shared decision-making
* Create rituals and workflows to sync the content workstream with sprint planning and review cycles
