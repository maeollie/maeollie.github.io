Hi! I'm Makayla. I am a content strategist, designer, and UX researcher. I create clear, compassionate, human-centered digital experiences for governments and public service organizations.

## I'm the team multi-tool

One of my co-workers once called me the “all-around do-what-needs-to-be-done person.” I grew up on a cattle ranch in Nebraska, where I developed midwestern pragmatism and a hard-nosed work ethic. My work is always rooted in relationships, trust, and empathy.

Most recently, I worked in the U.S. federal government on [Digital.gov](https://www.digital.gov), a one-stop shop for government employees learning how to create better digital experiences for the public. I also supported the federal government’s go-to resources for [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov) and the [Paperwork Reduction Act](https://pra.digital.gov). 

## I'm also a civic tech researcher

I fell sideways into civic tech while working on my master of public administration at UNC–Chapel Hill. My journey started with a project on [hiring digital talent](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/event/digital-service-team-hiring-insights-and-question-bank/) done with support from the Beeck Center at Georgetown University. My capstone research explored [tech talent retention in state and local government](https://digitalgovernmenthub.org/library/expectations-vs-reality-retention-challenges-and-strategies-for-u-s-state-and-local-government-digital-services-teams/).

## I’m usually not working!

Most of the time, I’m in my native plant garden, exploring indie bookstores, or hiking the Blue Ridge mountains with my husband and our two goofy dogs.
